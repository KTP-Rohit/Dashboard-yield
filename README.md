The connection string to the database is provided, along with Streamlit configuration settings to set the page title, page icon, layout, sidebar state, and font and layout size. The app allows the user to select a date and a table from a dropdown menu, and retrieves data from the selected table for the selected date using the appropriate class from the custom modules. The retrieved data is displayed in a DataFrame using Streamlit.
