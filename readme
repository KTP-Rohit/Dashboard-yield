The code is a Python script that generates a web application using Streamlit. The application retrieves data from a SQL Server database, displays the data in tables, and refreshes the data every 30 seconds. Below is a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

    The necessary libraries are imported. Pyodbc is used for connecting to SQL Server, Pandas is used for data manipulation, and Streamlit is used for creating the web application.

    The connection string to the SQL Server database is defined.

    The Streamlit page configuration is set. The page title is "Box Despatch Summary", the page icon is "ðŸ“¦", the layout is "wide", and the initial sidebar state is "collapsed".

    The font and layout size of the page is set using Markdown.

    The user is allowed to select a date using the Streamlit date_input function. The default value for the date is set to today's date.

    Two Streamlit "empty" elements are created to hold the Box Despatch Summary and Despatch Yield tables. These elements will be used later to display the tables.

    A while loop is started that will continuously run until the script is stopped.

    Inside the while loop, data is retrieved from the rep_BoxDespatchSummary and usr_DespatchYield tables in the SQL Server database for the selected date. The data is retrieved using two custom classes: BoxDespatchSummary and DespatchYield.

    The retrieved data is stored in Pandas dataframes (df1 and df2).

    If data is found for Box Despatch Summary, the data is displayed in a Streamlit dataframe using the box_summary_element. If no data is found, a message is displayed instead.

    If data is found for Despatch Yield, the data is displayed in a Streamlit dataframe using the despatch_yield_element. If no data is found, a message is displayed instead.

    The script waits for 30 seconds before running the loop again.

In summary, this code generates a simple web application that retrieves and displays data from a SQL Server database using Streamlit and Pandas. The data is refreshed every 30 seconds.
